# Contributing Guidelines

If you plan to contribute back to this repo, please fork & open a PR.

## Commit Conventions

We use [conventional-changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog) for commit messages. For committing changes, we recommend using a wizard:

```sh
yarn commit
```

If you prefer using `git`, try installing `commitizen` utility:

```sh
npm install commitizen -g
```

Then you can use a simple alias for generating commit messages:

```sh
git cz
```

If you prefer using VSCode, try using [VSCode Commitizen extension](https://github.com/KnisterPeter/vscode-commitizen).

## Development

```

Write tests and add new functionality.

core package.
